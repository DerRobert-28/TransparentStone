# TransparentStone

This resource pack makes the Minecraft stone block transparent.

It should be compatible to the most Minecraft versions.

Compatibility ends in versions, where textures are still stitched together inside the `textures.png` file.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/TransparentStone.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/TransparentStone.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

* Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC.
* Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your Minecraft data folder (see above).
* **IMPORTANT:** If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your Minecraft data folder, it will **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
